      "content": "# The Problem\n\nStarted with a simple idea: index our docs, make them searchable. Three hours later I'm debugging cosine similarity scores.\n\n## Architecture\n\n```python\nclass RAGPipeline:\n    def __init__(self, model='gpt-4'):\n        self.embedder = OpenAIEmbeddings()\n        self.vector_store = Pinecone()\n        self.llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model)\n```\n\n## Key Learnings\n\n- Chunk size matters more than you think (512 tokens sweet spot)\n- Overlap prevents context loss at boundaries\n- Reranking with a cross-encoder doubles relevance\n\n> The best RAG system is the one that ships.\n\n## Results\n\nWent from 23% accuracy to 87% on our eval set. Not bad for a night's work.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Implement caching layer\n2. Add async processing\n3. Monitor token usage",

      "content": "# Agent Design Space\n\nBuilding agentic systems requires thinking beyond simple prompts.\n\n## Pattern 1: ReAct (Reason + Act)\n\n**Thought**: What information do I need?\n**Action**: Search for relevant docs\n**Observation**: Found 3 relevant sources\n**Thought**: Now I can answer\n\n## Pattern 2: Chain of Thought\n\nBreak complex problems into steps. Ask the model to show its work.\n\n```typescript\nconst response = await agent.run({\n  task: \"Analyze this codebase\",\n  reasoning: \"step-by-step\",\n  tools: [\"grep\", \"ast-parser\", \"llm\"]\n});\n```\n\n## When to Use What\n\n| Pattern | Use Case | Latency |\n|---------|----------|--------|\n| ReAct | Tool-heavy tasks | High |\n| CoT | Reasoning-heavy | Medium |\n| Direct | Simple queries | Low |\n\n---\n\nShip early, iterate fast.",
