Redesign blog template for professional appearance

Major design improvements inspired by professional engineering blogs (Stripe, Linear, Vercel):

**Layout Changes:**
- Redesigned header with semantic HTML (header/nav/main tags)
- Removed old sidebar/hamburger navigation patterns
- Cleaner navigation with improved spacing and hover states
- Footer now links to jsonblog.dev instead of GitHub

**Post Page Improvements:**
- Post title now appears at top (larger, more prominent at 2.75rem)
- Date displays underneath title for better hierarchy
- Simplified AI indicator to subtle "AI-generated" badge
- Tags moved to footer section after content
- Better visual hierarchy with improved spacing

**Styling Enhancements:**
- Enhanced header with subtle bottom border for separation
- Professional AI indicator styling (subtle gray badge)
- Better spacing throughout (3rem margins, 2rem padding)
- Cleaner navigation without heavy borders
- Improved article title sizing and letter spacing

The design now follows patterns from professional engineering blogs while maintaining the minimal black & white aesthetic.
