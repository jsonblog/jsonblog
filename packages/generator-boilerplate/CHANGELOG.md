# @jsonblog/generator-boilerplate

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- Implement directory-based pretty URLs and add interactive particle animation

  **BREAKING CHANGE: File Structure**

  Both generators now use directory-based URLs (e.g., `/post-slug/index.html` instead of `/post-slug.html`). This enables pretty URLs that work on ALL platforms without server configuration.

  **Generated File Structure Changes:**
  - Posts: `post-slug.html` → `post-slug/index.html`
  - Pages: `about.html` → `about/index.html`
  - Tags: `tag/javascript.html` → `tag/javascript/index.html`
  - Categories: `category/tutorial.html` → `category/tutorial/index.html`
  - Pagination: `page/2.html` → `page/2/index.html`

  **Benefits:**
  - ✅ Pretty URLs work everywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3, etc.)
  - ✅ No server configuration required
  - ✅ Industry-standard approach (same as Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby)
  - ✅ SEO-friendly clean URLs

  **Updated:**
  - RSS feed URLs now use trailing slashes
  - Sitemap URLs now use trailing slashes
  - Dev server routing updated to handle directory structure

  **Tailwind Generator: Interactive Particle Animation**

  Replaced gradient hover effect with physics-based particle animation using tsparticles:
  - Blue particle network matching site accent color (#0066cc)
  - Interactive on hover - particles connect when mouse is near
  - Smooth, performant animation with 40 particles
  - Subtle opacity and size animations
  - ~100KB library size via CDN

  **Migration Guide:**

  If you have custom server rules that depend on `.html` extensions, you may need to update them. The new structure works automatically on most platforms:
  - **Vercel**: Works automatically, no changes needed
  - **Netlify**: Works automatically, no changes needed
  - **GitHub Pages**: Works automatically, no changes needed
  - **Nginx**: Add `try_files $uri $uri/ $uri/index.html =404;`
  - **Apache**: Already works with default settings

  **Technical Details:**
  - Dev servers updated to serve `/path/index.html` for `/path` requests
  - Template links remain unchanged (already used extensionless URLs)
  - All generators maintain consistent behavior

## 4.0.0 - 2025-11-20

### Major Changes

- Add generator configuration support

  Major enhancement allowing users to pass arbitrary configuration to generators through blog.json:

  **Schema Changes (@jsonblog/schema):**
  - Added `GeneratorConfigSchema` for validating generator configuration
  - Added optional `generator` field to `BlogSchema` with nested `name` and `config` properties
  - Both `name` and `config` fields are optional for maximum flexibility

  **CLI Changes (@jsonblog/cli):**
  - Added `getGeneratorName()` helper to extract generator name from blog.json (takes precedence over CLI flag)
  - Added `getGeneratorConfig()` helper to extract generator configuration
  - Updated `build()` function to pass configuration as 3rd parameter to generators
  - Updated `build` and `watch` commands to use new configuration system
  - Added logging to show when generator config is being used

  **Generator Changes (Breaking):**
  - Updated function signature to accept optional 3rd parameter: `generatorConfig: Record<string, any> = {}`
  - Both `@jsonblog/generator-boilerplate` and `@jsonblog/generator-tailwind` now support configuration
  - Generators log whether config is provided via `hasConfig` flag
  - Backward compatible: config parameter is optional with empty object default

  **Example Usage:**

  ```json
  {
    "site": { "title": "My Blog" },
    "basics": { "name": "Author" },
    "generator": {
      "name": "@jsonblog/generator-tailwind",
      "config": {
        "theme": {
          "colors": {
            "primary": "#007acc"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "posts": [...]
  }
  ```

  **Breaking Change:**
  Custom generator implementations must update their function signature to accept the optional 3rd `generatorConfig` parameter. Generators that don't update will still work (JavaScript allows extra arguments) but won't receive configuration.

  **Design:**
  Follows industry best practices from Gatsby, Babel, webpack, and other plugin-based tools with nested configuration patterns.
